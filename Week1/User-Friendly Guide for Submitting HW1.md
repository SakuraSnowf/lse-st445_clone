* Step 2: Then GitHub will automatically generate a repo for you. Importing the starter code might take a while. But sometimes the repo has already been created on GitHub even if it is still “importing” starter code. You can have a check on GitHub (Given in the following steps). After it is done, you will see the following window.

* Step 3: Go to you GitHub page, click the LSE organization. You will see a repo with 2020mt-st445-hw1-yourname. That’s the repo you will work on. Click that repo.

  * if your repo does not look like this (e.g. it is empty), please email us. Sometimes GitHub classroom fails to create the repo for you properly. We can either delete the repository for you so that you can accept the homework again, or add the files for you manually.

* Step 5: It looks as follows. Q1-3 Should have been finished during the class. Type in ‘Done’ in the cells below them (make them as Markdown cells). For Q4, paste your code into the cell below Q4. For Q5, it is optional. If you have made a personal page, just paste the link of your personal page there and save it as a markdown cell.
